# i-SenseCNN

*This will contain the finished files regarding our design project from testing different datasets up to the final product. The code created in the Google Colab will also serve as a documentation for future references.*

*Description of finished files:*
*   `Meat_Quality_Assessment_TL_Test_Documentation.ipynb` -> Testing the transfer learning code from YouTube (see link in the code) using the meat quality assessment dataset. Conclusion: accuracy fluctuates really bad making it unusable. ***Epochs: 100***;
*   `Multiclass_Test.ipynb` -> Testing a code from YouTube and adjusting it to accomodate Inception_V3 and use transfer learning to train it with a custom dataset that has 6 classes. Conclusion: Training success as well as testing. Consider increasing number of samples per class as well as increasing the number of epochs to reach a goal of at least 90% accuracy upon evaluation. ***Epochs: 100***;
